            On Harvard Business Review's website they utilize the concept of repetition by using the same text sizes for article names,
            maintaining a nav bar across every page,
            and maintaining the same visual style.
            By maintaining the same style they can more easily distinguish their news source from others.
            The logo always remains in the top left corner and the article titles use the same font across pages to keep the reader familiar with the content they are viewing.
            Repetition is really important because if the pages with the articles looked completely different readers would have more trouble following the content.

            Repetition is arguably the most important aspect of a good website.
            It's all about repeating style choices across the page.
            Again, this could include shapes, formats, colors, and fonts.
            Repetition helps the user feel more comfortable with the site itself and it also makes your content more recognizable.
            In my eyes a great example of this is using a Google page.
            Their simplistic style with sans serif fonts and consistent color palettes makes their UI very recognizable and easy to use.
            They upkeep this style across their browser and tools such as Drive, Slides, Docs, and more.

            The key thing to note is the difference between these two images.
            On the left the page on repetition is formatted with section headers and an indented paragraph.
            The headers are slightly bolded and maintain the same position across the page.
            The page on the right is covered in repetition errors.
            The headers do not maintain position and the second section header is a different color.
            The paragraphs also use different positioning and the first paragraph is a different font.
            The major issue with the second page is that there is no repetition of styles or positioning so the page is not only a mess but also fails to maintain an iconic style.
            This could make sections harder to interpret as readers down the line could perceive some content to be part of some sections they are not supposed to be.
