Movement on a webpage can add a lot of quality of life to the user experience. 
In general the idea of using movement on a website is to grab user attention and to make the page feel more 
interactive and alive. 
There are many different ways in which we can get a website to move. 
Some of the most common things websites use are slight size adjustments to objects being 
hovered over, pieces of videos played in the background, and moving panels that slide into view when scrolling 
down a page. 
Adjusting the positioning of elements by making them shake or grow when hovered over is very helpful as the user 
can more accurately tell what they were interacting with.
