        <h2>Serif Typefaces</h2>
        <p>
            Serif typefaces are easy to identify via the edges and foot of the letter.
            They are used for things that try to focus on sophistication.
            A good suggestion for this would be something like an academic article or a font for a book.
            These font styles give a more professional and experienced vibe.
            A few examples of such fonts include Times New Roman and Garamond which are examples of Serif fonts that are commonly used.
            They both have small stubs and details at the bottom of the letters and have little details at their ends as well.
            A very similar group is slab serif which uses blocky eds instead of curved ones.

        <h2>Sans Serif Typefaces</h2>
        <p>
            The sans serif typeface is all about the idea of simple text. As the name implies,
            it is in part like a serif typeface but what makes it different is that it removes the decorated and stylized edges of the fonts to make a clean and very legible font.
            Sans serif fonts are very versatile as they can be used in logos, headers, and in paragraphs.
            The most common sans serif fonts include Arial, Halvetica, and Futura.
            Overall the sans serif typeface is designed for legibility and ease of use.

    <h2>Script Typefaces</h2>
    <p>
        Script typefaces look somewhat like cursive handwriting and can be shown in a myriad of ways.
        Most often they are showcased in a bolded wavy font that pulls a reader's attention or makes something look more beautifully written.
        Some examples of these fonts include Hollins Brush, Groovy, Pacifico and many more.
        These are often used for titles or cover image fonts as they can be difficult to read in smaller sizes and make the page feel cluttered.
        Some brands such as Sharpie, Vimeo,
        and Instagram use a script type font in their logo.

    <h2>Display Typefaces</h2>
    <p>
        Display typefaces are iconic for their standout on a page.
        Most often a display typeface will be extra large on an advertisement or flier as they are usually thicker and sometimes are in wacky shapes and styles.
        A few example fonts include Monoton, Broadway, and Douglas.
        The main idea is that these fonts are your page headers and the ones that really pop on the page.
        The main difference between these and a lot of script faces are that script fonts are more wavy and look more handwritten.
        Display fonts are different in the sense that they are often thicker and use less cursive.

    <p>
        Typeface and font are different things.
        The typeface is the overarching style the fonts are supposed to convey.
        That could be something of sophistication, simplicity, or bold text to capture attention.
        Font is the direct formatting of the letters and brings the typeface to life.
