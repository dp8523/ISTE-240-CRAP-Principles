<div class="tightText">
<p> For the concept of repetition the Law of Uniform Connectedness is very useful. 
    It is a Gestalt idea that essentially said people connect things together based on similar designs and styles. 
    For repetition this is a critical idea as repetition is all about setting 
    a style to make your website more iconic or memorable to the user. 
    Knowing this principle you can more clearly understand the importance of picking colors, shapes, and typography 
    of similar style as those designs need to work together in order to make the user feel more connected and
    comfortable on the page.
