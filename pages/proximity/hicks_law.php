When designing a webpage a key factor people should consider is Hick's Law.
In short it states that it is inherently better to have only the key essential elements as it makes navigation easier
for the user and be more aesthetically pleasing. 
When it comes to a clean design simplicity is key as many sites often suffer from clutter making it hard to 
navigate and understand.

In the graph above it explains how the time it takes to navigate increases with an increase in the number of choices.
So if there are for example 100 choices, it would take longer to select one than if there were 10 choices.
This is the exact reason we need to have less choices as it makes information more accessible.

In this image the possible options are limited making information easier to access. 
The navigation bar only has 4 options for the user to select.
The site designer could also add drop down menus for each of the navigation options that have sub-topics, just like our
navigation on this website.
It makes content easier to understand and it also allows for more space to place images and other pieces of content.
