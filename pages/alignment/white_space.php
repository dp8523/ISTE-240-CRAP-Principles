        <h2>Introduction to White Space</h2>
        <p>
            White space, or negative space, is the empty space around and between elements in a design. Itâ€™s a critical part of any layout, as it
            helps to create breathing room and gives content a structured appearance. By balancing content with white space, designers
            can make pages more readable, comfortable, and visually appealing.

        <h2>Why White Space Matters</h2>
        <p>
            White space enhances both aesthetics and functionality by creating separation and clarity. It helps users navigate the page effortlessly,
            making the design appear intentional and polished. Effective use of white space not only improves readability but also contributes
            to an enjoyable, accessible user experience.
