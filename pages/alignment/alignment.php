        <h2>Introduction to Alignment</h2>
        <p>
            Alignment is crucial for maintaining a clear, organized structure in design. It helps guide the viewerâ€™s eye through the page
            in a logical flow, reducing clutter and increasing readability. Proper alignment creates a visual hierarchy, making it easier for
            users to understand the relationship between different elements on a page.

        <h2>Why Alignment Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Proper alignment not only enhances aesthetics but also improves the user experience by creating a sense of order.
            When content is aligned, users can navigate more intuitively, ensuring that the design feels cohesive and easy to follow.
