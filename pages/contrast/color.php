        A huge part of any design is the use of color and texture. Color is obviously directly
        tied to contrast as color contrast and as mentioned used to distinguish items,
        increase visibility, and stylize the content. Color choices can be tied directly
        to color theory as well. For example if you want people to feel more welcome you
        could use a warmer color palette with more red, orange, and yellow. Another example
        is if you want to make content surrounding ecosystems, using some dark greens, browns,
        and blues can help to give it a more natural vibe. Texture can also be just as important
        in some circumstances. Using images and content that have despicable texture can add a
        lot to a design. Let's say you wanted an advertisement for a book festival, adding content
        that depicts paper and cover textures that can impact the feeling of the page. You can
        use textures on images or backgrounds that text or other images can be on top of.

        In this image you can somewhat get an idea of what textures are like on a page. Viewing
        them makes you visualize what the sensation of that texture is without actually touching
        it. This can help set the scene for the viewer's brain when viewing a website.

        This image depicts many brand logos and their color choices which bring out different feelings.
        Color theory also changes when you bring different shades and content as different colors can
        better represent different items. For reference, when you go to a supermarket and buy an organic
        ingredient it is most likely the color green as we associate green with nature and if they are
        selling an organic product they want the consumer to feel like it is natural.
