<h1>What is C.R.A.P.?</h1>
<p>
    CRAP stands for contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity.
    They are four fundamental principles of good web design. This website
    goes over each one along with diagrams, examples from other websites,
    and our own examples. We also aim to demonstrate the principles through
    the design of this entire site.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to these four main principles, we also delve into subtopics
    that detail specific ways to adhere to the guidelines their respective
    principle.

    <h2>Contrast</h2>
    <p>
        This is about making elements stand out both for accessibility and
        drawing people's attention. It also plays a role in making a page
        visually appealing. This is most commonly achieved through varying
        text size and selecting colors so that elements don't blend into
        the background.
    </p>

    <h2>Repetition</h2>
    <p>
        This is about maintaining consistency across the piece you are working on.
        This could include fonts, color palettes, and design formats. The cohesion
        helps maintain an organized and clean look throughout the entire website.
    </p>

    <h2>Alignment</h2>
    <p>
        This is about keeping your elements in central areas and positioning them
        in a way that makes the content unified with the page. It also creates a
        visual hierarchy that guides viewers through the logical hierarchy of the
        content.
    </p>

    <h2>Proximity</h2>
    <p>
        This is all about the spacing between content. For example, if you have a
        bunch of text squeezed tightly together it may make content feel more cramped
        and uncomfortable to read. If a caption is too far from its image, users may
        not understand that they are linked. If you evenly space out materials, the
        overall design of the page will also be much more aesthetically pleasing.
